            <h2 class="creative">Taj Mahal</h2>
              <p> The Taj Mahal  more often meaning Crown of the Palace is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river 
                  in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628â€“1658), to house the tomb 
                  of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)[6] complex, which includes a mosque and 
                  a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
                  
              <p> Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 
                  10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be 
                  around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (US$827 million). The construction project 
                  employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad 
                  Lahauri.</p>

                <p>        
                The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, a Persian
                 princess who died giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[8] Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632.[9] 
                 The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrate the love story held as the
                  inspiration for Taj Mahal.[10][11] The principal mausoleum was completed in 1643[9] and the surrounding buildings and 
                  garden were finished about five years later.</p>

              <h2 class="creative">Architecture and design</h2>
              <p> The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. 
                    Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur,
                    progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[12] Humayun's Tomb, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and
                     Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan 
                     promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of
                      refinement.</p>
